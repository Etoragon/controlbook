The first question asks us to find the transfer fucntion from Theta D to Theta given the closed loop.

This answer is already given a little later in the text and is as follows

          kp * b0 
    ----------------------
    s^2 + kd*b0*s + kp*b0

Meaning our characteristic polynomial is

s^2 + kd*b0*s + kp*b0

Finally, with a desired rise time of tr = 0.5 s and a dampening ratio of C = 0.707, we will find kp and kd with respect to the rise time

Our desired characteristic polynomial is 

s^2 + 2*C*wn*s + wn^2 = 0

and so 

kd*b0 = 2*C*wn
kd*b0 = 2*(0.707)*(2.2/tr)
kd    = 2*(0.707)*(2.2/tr)*(1/b0)

kp*b0 = wn^2
kp    = (2.2/tr)^2*(1/b0)

And as such we have found our gains with respect to our desired rise time
